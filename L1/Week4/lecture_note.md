# Introduction to R and the Tidyverve

1. **R Software Environment**
    - Freely available for statistical computing.
    - Popular among the data science community.
2. **Importance in Data Science**
    - Supports the full data science workflow.
3. **Data Scientist's Workflow**
    - **Messy Raw Data**: Initial stage involves handling raw, unstructured data.
    - **Tidying Data**: Transforming raw data into a workable format.
    - **Data Manipulation**: Preparing data for analysis or visualization.
    - **Analysis and Visualization**: Often requires further tidying and manipulation.
    - **Dissemination**: Sharing results through reports, papers, or online tools.
4. **Three Interconnected Steps**
    - **Preparation**: Tidying and manipulating data.
    - **Analysis**: Conducting analysis.
    - **Dissemination**: Sharing findings.
5. **Tidyverse**
    - A series of R packages designed for the data science workflow.
    - Built on the principles of consistency and ease of use.
    - Uses easy-to-understand verbs for functions.
    - Emphasizes working with data via code that is straightforward.
6. **Principles for Tidy Data**
    - **Variables**: Each variable is a column.
    - **Observations**: Each observation is a row.
    - **Values**: Every value is in its own cell.
7. **Impact on Clinical Data Science**
    - The Tidyverse has had a significant impact.
    - Emphasizes putting data at the forefront of analysis.
    - Facilitates making decisions explicit, crucial for clinical data implementation.

# Introduction to RStudio

1. **Overview**
    - RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
    - Available as a free desktop download or server deployment.
    - Commercial licenses are offered for larger companies.
2. **Server Hosting**
    - Supported by Google Cloud health care and RStudio.
    - Server version of RStudio available for free use in this specialization at [rstudio.LearnClinicalDatascience.org](http://rstudio.learnclinicaldatascience.org/).
3. **RStudio Interface**
    - **Four Main Sections**:
        - **Rscript and Data Views**: Where you do most of your work.
        - **Console**: Displays the results of running code.
        - **Workspace and History**: Shows data, values, and command history.
        - **Files, Plots, Packages, Help**: Manages files, displays plots, shows packages and help documentation.
4. **Working with RStudio**
    - **Creating Scripts**: Go to File > New File to create new scripts.
    - **Running Code**: Select code and click run or press Command + Enter to execute in the Console tab.
    - **Viewing Results**: Results are displayed in the Console tab.
    - **Workspace and History**: Displays available data and command history.
    - **Packages**: View and load packages in the active console.
    - **Help**: Search for information about packages or commands.
5. **Handling Figures and Files**
    - **Plots**: Figures generated by code appear in the Plots tab.
    - **Files**: Manage files in the Files tab.
    - **Importing Files**: Download code from Coursera and upload it via the Files tab.
    - **Saving Files**: Select files, click the gear icon, and choose export to save files to your computer.
6. **Saving and Accessing Files**
    - **Saving Work**: Save files before closing the website to retain access.
    - **Backup**: It is recommended to save copies of important files to prevent loss.
