# Introduction to Clinical Data Science

### Definition and Context

- **Data Science**: Combination of computer science, mathematics, domain knowledge, and communication skills.
- **Clinical Data Science**: Utilizes healthcare data to generate new knowledge and improve patient care.
- **Biomedical Data Science**: Encompasses biological systems to population health.

### Related Fields

- **Healthcare Data Science**: Similar to healthcare analytics; focuses on healthcare business rather than individual patient health.
- **Health Data Science**: Encompasses clinical and nonclinical data, including fitness, sleep, and wellness data.
- **Biomedical Informatics**: Interdisciplinary science translating data into knowledge and knowledge into action.

### Key Components of Clinical Data Science

- **Data Generation**: Derived from healthcare providers and health systems.
- **Knowledge Generation**: Using data to produce new insights.
- **Patient Care Improvement**: Applying insights to enhance future patient care.

### Overlapping and Emerging Terms

- **Healthcare Data Science vs. Health Data Science**: No consensus on differences; often overlapping in practice.
- **Health Data Science Education Programs**: Often align closely with biomedical data science.

### Informaticiansâ€™ Role

- **Broad Perspective**: Informaticians integrate data collection, management, and analysis.
- **System and Implementation Science**: Designing technology-based interventions for healthcare systems.
- **Knowledge to Action**: Emphasizes practical application of data insights.

### Importance of Social Science and Healthcare System Understanding

- **Social Science Knowledge**: Essential for implementing data science discoveries.
- **Healthcare System Insight**: Understanding the system impacts data usage and analysis.
- **Effective Implementation**: Requires careful attention to healthcare environment for adoption of discoveries.

### Course Focus

- **Tool and Method Teaching**: Developed by informaticians for clinical data analysis.
- **Impacting Change**: Emphasizes leveraging clinical data to effect practical improvements in patient care.

# Clinical Data Regulations

### Overview of HIPAA

- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, established in 1996.
- **Privacy Rule**: Regulations on use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI).
- **PHI**: Individually identifiable health information (e.g., demographic data, health data).

### Key Entities and Rules

- **Covered Entities**: Health plans, clearing houses, healthcare providers transmitting health information electronically.
- **Identified Data**: Clinical data containing PHI.
- **TPO (Treatment, Payment, Operations)**: Allowed uses of PHI without additional consent.

### Data Types and Use

- **Fully Identified Data**: Used for TPO purposes.
- **Psychotherapy Notes**: Exception to standard PHI use; require additional protections.
- **Limited Data Set**: Partial removal of PHI (e.g., 16 direct identifiers removed) requiring a Data Use Agreement.
- **De-identified Data**: Data with all 18 identifiers plus zip codes and dates removed. No privacy rule restrictions on its use.

### De-identification Methods

- **Safe Harbor Method**: Removal of 18 specific identifiers.
- **Expert Determination Method**: Expert assesses that re-identification risk is very small.
- **Date Shifting**: Dates in records are randomly shifted to maintain data utility while preserving privacy.

### Minimum Necessary Principle

- **Application**: Only the minimum amount of data necessary should be used for a given purpose.
- **Challenge**: Exploratory analyses may require more data than initially anticipated.

### Impact on Clinical Data Science

- **Data Limitations**: De-identified data limits analysis types, especially involving dates and text notes.
- **Ethical Responsibility**: Respect patient privacy and the potential impact of data use.
- **Historical Context**: Health data misuse has led to discrimination, emphasizing the importance of data protection.

### Practical Application

- **Quality Improvement Projects**: Often performed under TPO authorization.
- **Exploratory Analyses**: Challenges arise due to the minimum necessary principle.

### Conclusion

- **Respect and Regulation**: Understanding and adhering to HIPAA regulations is crucial.
- **Patient Trust**: Protecting health data is essential to maintain trust and ensure ethical data science practices.
